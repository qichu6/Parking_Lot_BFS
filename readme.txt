1. to run the program
Firstly, compile the program(all the java files). 
Type "javac Area.java" on the command line.
Type "javac BFS.java" on the command line.
Type "javac Vehicle.java" on the command line.
Type "javac BFS_2.java" on the command line.
Type "javac BFS_random.java" on the command line.
Then, execute the program. 
Type "java BFS” on the command line. (the word after java should be the class name)(the level one will be shown)
Type "java BFS_2” on the command line. (the word after java should be the class name)(the level two will be shown)
Type "java BFS_random” on the command line. (the word after java should be the class name)(the random situation will be shown)


2. introduction of each part in the program
1)class vehicle: The vehicle class and area class includes some constructors to initialize data. Particularly, the four directions: up, down, left, right are corresponding to 1, 2, 3, 4 to be easy to express later.
2)class The data generation was written in the main function which would be different when you run the program each time. (random generating)
